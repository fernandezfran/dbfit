## Repository description

This repository uses the [LiionDB](https://github.com/ndrewwang/liiondb) SQL 
database with an extensive catalogue of reported battery parameters in scalar and 
functional forms.

After running an SQL query and cleaning the data, the parameters obtained are 
used to simulate specific systems and then fit them into a universal framework, 
all this is done using the [galpynostatic](https://github.com/fernandezfran/galpynostatic) 
package along with other Python libraries of the data science stack.
